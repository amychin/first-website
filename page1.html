                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>A dachshund is a breed of <strong>domesticated canine</strong> colloquially known as "sausage" dogs, "wiener" dogs or "badger" dogs.
                    They come in a variety of sizes including standard, miniature, and the in-between "tweenie" size. Their coats can be smooth, long hair, or wire hair.
                    Dachshunds are a breed of hounds that were originally bred as hunting dogs. Their long bodies and short legs allow them to burrow through small ditches and
                    tunnels in the ground in search for prey animals such as bunnies and badgers. They still exhibit this behavior as household pets
                    through digging and burying themselves under blankets.

                <h2>Reasons to get one</h2>
                <p>Dachshunds make a great companion. They are goofy and playful. They can be found in solid, dappled, piebald, sable, and brindle patterns.
                    Their coat, color, pattern, and size combinations allow for a very unique looking dog. Head to our gallery for examples.</p>

                <h2>Reasons not to</h2>
                <p><em>None</em>. Except, if you cannot resist the large eyes and long face combination
                that gives them permanent puppy dog eyes, a dachshund may not be for you.</p>
